I am a developer based out of **Grand Rapids, MI**. I have been writing code since I was little and I still enjoy doing it, both as a job and a hobby.

I've developed in almost every layer of a wide range of tech-stacks. Lately I've been enjoying building **websites and web-apps**, primarily focused on the **Front-End and Service Layer**.

I believe in doing all things to the best of my ability. I build my products to be robust, accessible, and as simple as possible.

I believe that products are built for users - not just to solve abstract technical problems. The most technically innovative code is worthless if the end-user experience is subpar.
