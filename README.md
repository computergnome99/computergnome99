- Do all things to the best of your ability.
- Build products that are robust, accessible, and as simple as possible.
- Products are built for users, not just to solve abstract technical problems: The most technically innovative code is worthless if the end-user experience is subpar.
- Don't write cute code.

> A dog barks when his master is attacked. I would be a coward if I saw that God's truth is attacked and yet would remain silent. For if I am silent when God's truth is assailed, I shall be denying Him whom I profess to serve. As a faithful watchman, I must bark when I see the wolf coming to attack the flock.
